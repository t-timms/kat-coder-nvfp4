## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- **GGUF + pruned-bf16 releases (2026-08-29).** `Ttimms/KAT-Coder-V2.5-Dev-REAP-50-GGUF`
  (Q4_K_M / Q5_K_M / Q6_K / Q8_0) and `Ttimms/KAT-Coder-V2.5-Dev-REAP-50-bf16` (pruned
  source, 38 GB) are now published — NVFP4A16 needs vLLM + Blackwell, which caps the
  audience; GGUF is the reach artifact and bf16 lets others make their own quants. Built
  from a fresh renorm-on REAP re-run (the original pruned bf16 had been deleted):
  `convert_hf_to_gguf.py --no-mtp` (KAT base already carries `mtp_num_hidden_layers: 0`),
  verified via `llama-server`. Ollama's bundled llama.cpp is still too old for
  `qwen3_5_moe`; LM Studio / current llama.cpp work. Standing rule going forward: every
  model ships GGUF + bf16 alongside NVFP4 (MLX is Mac-gated).
- **Full-pilot tested `presence_penalty`/`top_k` — regresses the score, not
  promoted.** 50-instance pilot on the identical instance set as the 52.0%
  baseline (`--shuffle` is deterministically seeded in mini-swe-agent, so
  both runs drew the same 50 instances - confirmed against its source
  before trusting the comparison). Result: **24/50 = 48.0%, down from
  26/50 = 52.0%.** `LimitsExceeded` failures rose from ~0 to 8 as instances
  exhausted the fixed 65-step turn budget exploring alternatives instead of
  repeating verbatim, more than offsetting a modest drop in
  `ContextWindowExceeded` (17→14) and a small quality improvement on
  attempts that did complete (85.7% vs 81.25% resolved-of-completed).
  `kat_overrides_sota.yaml` is unchanged and remains the best validated
  config - this result confirms the promotion-discipline correction earlier
  this week was the right call, not just a process nicety. Full breakdown:
  `ROADMAP.md`'s RESULT entry.

- **Tried a GPTQ-based NVFP4A16 requantization (`scripts/quantize/quantize_kat_gptq.py`)
  — clean run, no measurable accuracy win, not shipped.** The shipped
  checkpoint uses plain round-to-nearest (RTN); GPTQ corrects each layer for
  the error its own rounding introduces, via a Hessian-based least-squares
  pass. Verified before running, not assumed: GPTQ+NVFP4 has shipped in
  llm-compressor since v0.10.0, and 2026 literature confirms GPTQ
  "consistently outperforms RTN" for NVFP4 recovery in general. Ran to
  completion in 5h23min, zero exceptions, zero RTN-fallback warnings across
  all 15,520 target modules; stripped size 12.4512 GiB, an exact
  byte-for-byte match to the shipped model. But the accuracy suite showed
  **no statistically significant difference** on either benchmark (paired
  McNemar: HumanEval+ p=0.68 at 6/164 discordant pairs, MBPP+ p=0.81 at
  18/378 — both underpowered to fully rule out a small real effect, but
  neither showing one). Did not clear the bar set before running (accuracy
  improvement required before any SWE-bench testing), so not shipped, not
  the default. Published as [`Ttimms/KAT-Coder-V2.5-Dev-REAP-50-NVFP4A16-GPTQ`](https://huggingface.co/Ttimms/KAT-Coder-V2.5-Dev-REAP-50-NVFP4A16-GPTQ)
  for completeness and independent verification of this null result, not as
  a recommended alternative to the primary release. Full writeup, including
  why a null result here is plausible (this model's RTN baseline may already
  be close to its accuracy ceiling) rather than contradicting the literature:
  `ROADMAP.md`'s RESULT entry.

- **Added `presence_penalty` and `top_k` to `kat_overrides_sota.yaml`,
  completing the base model's own documented sampling recommendation.**
  `Kwaipilot/KAT-Coder-V2.5-Dev`'s model card documents `temperature=1.0,
  top_p=0.95, presence_penalty=1.5, top_k=20` together for Thinking mode;
  this config only carried the first two. Found while diagnosing a
  SWE-bench agent stuck in a genuine repetition loop (re-issuing an
  identical command 6 times, self-aware of it — "I've been going in
  circles" — and looping anyway). Tested on that exact instance with 3
  repeated draws (not 1 — this config samples at `temperature: 1.0`, so a
  single draw can't separate signal from sampling noise): 0/3 draws hit
  `ContextWindowExceededError` afterward, versus 1/1 before; checked
  directly, one draw's 65 turns used 64 distinct commands, versus the
  earlier literal 6x-repeat. Real, measured suppression of that specific
  failure — not a full fix (all 3 draws still took far more turns than a
  clean baseline run, and one still failed a different way). **Full-pilot
  re-validation of the SWE-bench score with this change has not been run
  yet** — the published 52.0% figure below predates this change. Full
  writeup and raw trajectories:
  `t-timms/kat-coder-16gb-serving-experiments`, `sampling-params/NOTES.md`.

- **SWE-bench Verified raised from 40.0% to 52.0% (26/50) by raising both the
  context ceiling (32K→49K) and the agent step limit (40→65).** Ran the full
  50-instance pilot at `max_model_len 49152, max_num_seqs 2, step_limit 65`
  (`kat_overrides_sota.yaml`, context validated single-instance beforehand,
  now the default in `run_pilot_all.sh`), graded with the official
  `swebench.harness.run_evaluation`: 0 infrastructure failures, 0 crashes.
  The mechanism (corrected after an initial write-up used the wrong
  denominator — see below): context-window failures barely moved (17/50 =
  34% vs. the prior 18/50 = 36%). The real lever was the step limit —
  `LimitsExceeded` failures (running out of agent turns, a separate failure
  mode from the context ceiling) dropped from 9 to 0, letting 10 more
  instances (22→32 `completed_instances`) reach a real attempt. Those newly
  reachable instances resolve at a lower rate than ones already completing
  (resolved-of-completed: 90.9%, 20/22, at 32K/step-40 → 81.25%, 26/32, at
  49K/step-65 — consistent with them being the harder problems needing the
  extra turns), but enough resolved anyway that the net count still rose
  (20→26). Prior 32K/40.0% config preserved and documented as the
  reproducible baseline (`MAXLEN=32768 MAXSEQS=8 KAT_CONFIG=kat_overrides.yaml`).
  Updated README.md, HF_MODEL_CARD.md, and `run_pilot_all.sh`'s defaults
  accordingly.

- **Self-correction, same day:** the first write-up of the SWE-bench result
  above compared 26 resolved against 32 *non-CWE* instances for both runs,
  treating that as "completed." Wrong for the old run: its actual
  `completed_instances` (from its own committed report) is 22, not 32 — a
  third failure category, `LimitsExceeded`, was missed. This inflated the
  apparent old resolved-of-completed rate's *direction of change* (originally
  reported as improving, 62.5%→81.25%; actually declining, 90.9%→81.25%) and
  attributed the win to the wrong mechanism (completion quality, rather than
  the step-limit fix reaching previously-unreachable instances). Caught by
  re-deriving both runs' numbers from their raw JSON reports on request to
  audit the night's work, rather than trusting the prior write-up. Corrected
  in README.md, HF_MODEL_CARD.md (including the already-published live HF
  model card), ROADMAP.md, and this entry.

- **W4A4 re-quantization built, measured, and published as an alternative
  build.** 4096-token calibration, vision-tower stripped, smoke-tested
  clean under both eager mode and (after a crash on the first attempt,
  traced to a one-time JIT-compile hiccup and confirmed clean on rerun)
  production PIECEWISE CUDA graphs. Measured against the published A16
  checkpoint with 5 interleaved invocations per arm under both execution
  modes: W4A4 decodes at 0.77x A16 in eager mode and 0.84x under PIECEWISE
  (119.2 vs 142.5 tok/s), with a mixed accuracy picture (HumanEval 92.07%
  vs 95.7%, HumanEval+ 89.02% vs 90.9%, MBPP+ 91.01% vs 89.9% — that last
  one favors W4A4). A16 remains the faster build on this hardware for
  single-stream decode and stays the default release; W4A4 is published
  separately as
  [`Ttimms/KAT-Coder-V2.5-Dev-REAP-50-NVFP4-W4A4`](https://huggingface.co/Ttimms/KAT-Coder-V2.5-Dev-REAP-50-NVFP4-W4A4)
  for anyone who wants the native FP4×FP4 tensor-core execution path
  specifically, or wants to verify or extend the comparison. Full writeup
  in `ROADMAP.md`'s RESULT section and
  `docs/optimization_research_2026-08-21.md` §4; corrected an earlier,
  wrong "~+31% throughput, already measured" claim along the way, traced to
  an uncited pre-measurement guess in the A16 quantize script's docstring.

- **Audited vLLM 0.27.1, the `lna-lab/blackwell-geforce-nvfp4-gemm` community
  SM120 patches, and NVFP4 KV cache as candidate upgrades; rejected all three
  for the current checkpoint, with evidence.** Full writeup in
  `docs/optimization_research_2026-08-21.md`. Headline finding: MoE experts
  fall back to the Marlin kernel because our NVFP4A16 checkpoint is
  weight-only (no matching FP4×FP4 hardware MMA path exists for that scheme
  on *any* GPU, not a device-support gap any patch or vLLM version can close);
  the community patches turned out to already be upstream in 0.27.1 and would
  have changed nothing. 0.27.1 also carries a new fixed ~1 GiB memory overhead
  that broke KV cache allocation at settings 0.26.0 runs comfortably on.
  Serving config is unchanged as a result — `kat_overrides_sota.yaml`'s
  `MAXLEN=49152 MAXSEQS=2` on vLLM 0.26.0 remains correct. See `ROADMAP.md`
  for the actual lever (W4A4 re-quantization) this audit points to next.

- **Measured NVFP4A16 against NVFP4 W4A4** on the same pruned checkpoint, same
  ignore list, same greedy decoding. W4A4 costs -0.6 pp on HumanEval+ and -0.3 pp
  on MBPP+, one problem in each; QSpec's 38.73% HumanEval collapse did not
  reproduce, that figure being INT4-era rather than NVFP4. The scheme also decides
  the kernel: vLLM routes A16 to Marlin and reports no native FP4 support, while
  W4A4 reaches `FlashInferCutlassNvFp4LinearKernel`, so the native FP4 GEMM on
  SM120 is available only to schemes that quantize activations. W4A4's first load
  costs 833 s of FlashInfer JIT against roughly 40 s for A16. Raw results in
  `results/eval-w4a4/`. Not published as a checkpoint: the accuracy is a wash and
  the JIT cost is a usability trap.

- **`scripts/probes/verify_repo.py` and a `verify` CI workflow.** Checks the
  invariants whose violations were actually found here: unresolvable relative
  links, duplicate headings inside a changelog release, Python that does not
  compile, and documentation that points at upstream `reap` instead of the fork.
  Needs no GPU, checkpoint, or pipeline environment, so it runs on every push.
- **`scripts/probes/capture_environment.sh`**, which prints the exact version of
  every component the pipeline depends on, including the `reap` commit and
  whether that checkout is dirty.
- **`CITATION.cff`**.

- **Release checkpoint published:** [`Ttimms/KAT-Coder-V2.5-Dev-REAP-50-NVFP4A16`](https://huggingface.co/Ttimms/KAT-Coder-V2.5-Dev-REAP-50-NVFP4A16)
  — 12.45 GiB, REAP 50% expert pruning plus NVFP4A16, vision tower removed.
- **`scripts/release/`**, which builds the shippable checkpoint from the quantized
  output. It verifies by artifact: the written safetensors header is re-parsed, the
  build fails if any vision tensor survives, and the result is checked against the
  documented size. `docs/checkpoint_composition.md` describes what the checkpoint
  contains and why.

- **SWE-bench Verified 50-instance results:** 20/50 = 40.0% under the standard
  metric, 20/22 = 90.9% when the model produces a valid patch. Bottlenecks:
  18 ContextWindowExceeded (32K ceiling), 9 LimitsExceeded, 1 garbage patch
  out of 23 generated. Results in
  `results/hosted_vllm__kat-16gb.kat-coder-16gb-50.json`.
- **`kat_overrides_context_managed.yaml`, an opt-in, unvalidated alternative
  agent config** (`step_limit=30`, `max_tokens=1024`, 5K observation
  truncation, down from 40/3072/10K) aimed at the 18 ContextWindowExceeded
  failures above. Select it with `KAT_CONFIG=kat_overrides_context_managed.yaml`
  when invoking `run_pilot_all.sh`; default behavior is unchanged. Tightening
  `max_tokens` this far risks truncating the model's mandatory `<think>` trace
  mid-turn, which would show up as format failures instead of CWEs rather than
  as a net win — this needs a real run before it's trusted either way.

- **Model card published to Hugging Face,** content identical to
  `HF_MODEL_CARD.md` in this repo.

### Changed

- **Renamed to `KAT-Coder-V2.5-Dev-REAP-50-NVFP4A16`** on GitHub and Hugging Face,
  matching the `{base}-REAP-{ratio}-{quant}` convention used by comparable
  checkpoints. Old URLs redirect.

- **`max_num_seqs` 2 → 8** in `serve_kat.sh` and `run_pilot_all.sh`, tested
  2026-08-19: 1.86x concurrency headroom at the 32K context length with no
  reduction in per-sequence KV budget. Throughput/concurrency only — does not
  change the SWE-bench score above.

### Fixed

- **Reverted a premature default-config change; split `presence_penalty`/`top_k`
  into its own opt-in candidate file.** They had been added directly into
  `kat_overrides_sota.yaml` — the same file that produced the cited 52.0%
  SWE-bench result — based on a single-instance test, which meant a fresh
  clone no longer reproduced that number by default. `kat_overrides_sota.yaml`
  is now reverted to byte-identical with the config that actually produced
  52.0%; the candidate lives in `kat_overrides_sota_presence_penalty.yaml`,
  selected explicitly, never silently the default. `sync_configs.sh` was also
  missing this new file from its hardcoded sync list — fixed. `HF_MODEL_CARD.md`
  re-synced to match. Full explanation: `ROADMAP.md`'s dated correction entry.
- **`eval_suite.sh`'s summary loop silently printed a blank MBPP+ line on
  successful runs.** Same two-metric-spelling issue the script's own comment
  already described for `run_task` (`pass@1,...` vs `pass_at_1,...`), but
  the fix was only ever applied to `run_task`, not the summary loop below
  it. Found comparing the GPTQ candidate against the RTN baseline — the
  per-task line had the real MBPP+ score, the summary section didn't.
- **`docs/environment.md` documented an unreproducible build.** It instructed
  cloning upstream `CerebrasResearch/reap`, but the release was built from
  `t-timms/reap-cuda` at `2954ba3`, which carries the router-renormalization fix.
  Upstream silently disables renormalization for this architecture, so anyone
  following the setup would have built a materially different model without any
  error — the pruned checkpoint is named `reap-renorm_true-...` precisely because
  that flag is part of its identity. The fork, branch and commit are now pinned.
- **The environment table described a stack that no longer exists.** It listed
  `transformers 4.57.1` and vLLM 0.20.2 for the serving environment; the machine
  now runs 5.15.1 and 0.26.0. Benchmark-era and current versions are now recorded
  separately, because the 149.5 tok/s and CUDA-graph results are specific to the
  0.20.2 build while the accuracy figures are not.
- **The smoke test contradicted the README.** Its docstring called CUDA graph
  capture "numerically broken on SM120" while the README's headline benchmark runs
  on CUDA graphs and reports a 7.4x speedup from them. The docstring was stale; it
  now states the real reason the smoke test runs eager.
- **"NVFP4 compute is numerically correct on this architecture" overstated what
  runs.** NVFP4A16 is weight-only, and vLLM selects the Marlin NVFP4 kernel on this
  card — it decodes 4-bit weights and computes in bf16. No FP4 arithmetic is
  required or performed. Reworded to say what actually executes.
- **License rationale cited the wrong source.** Apache 2.0 is inherited from the
  base model; the toolchain licences merely happen to agree.
- **`read_scores.py` printed a Wilson interval for standard-error rows,** which is
  meaningless for a value that is not a proportion.

- **The build emitted 0.83 GiB of untrained vision weights into the checkpoint.**
  `KAT-Coder-V2.5-Dev` declares a vision tower and ships no weights for it, so
  transformers materialises 333 random tensors at load, `reap` saves them, and the
  quantizer's `re:visual.*` rule preserves them at full BF16. Removing
  `vision_config` from `config.json` strips the declaration and none of the weight.
  The release build now removes both, giving 12.4512 GiB against a documented
  12.45 GiB. Found during release verification; no affected checkpoint was
  published. Detail in `docs/checkpoint_composition.md`.
- **`scripts/bench/smoke_pruned_nvfp4.py` ignored `KAT_MODEL`.** The model path was
  hardcoded, so the documented invocation could validate a checkpoint other than the
  one being shipped.
- **Smoke-test token budget.** KAT emits a `<think>` preamble that can consume a
  300-token cap before any code is produced, scoring a healthy run as "no
  recognisable code". The budget is now 768 (`KAT_MAX_TOKENS`), and truncation is
  reported separately from incoherence.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-18

Accuracy measured, agentic serving solved, SWE-bench pipeline wired end to end.
The model is now a measured agentic coder, not just a fast one.

### Added

- **Accuracy results.** HumanEval+ 89.0% [83.3, 92.9] and MBPP+ 90.5% [87.1, 93.0]
  on the release candidate, greedy decoding, instruct framing. ~8 min for 706
  problems, only affordable with CUDA graphs enabled.
- **Agentic serving config.** PIECEWISE graph mode costs 7% speed and buys 4.4x
  context (64,976 vs 14,672 tokens). Prefix caching is worth 45x on replayed
  history (0.21 s vs 30.74 s for a 13K-token history). Required flags:
  `--enable-prefix-caching --max-num-batched-tokens 4096` (the 2048 default sits
  48 tokens under the Mamba block_size assertion).
- **SWE-bench Verified pipeline** via mini-swe-agent 2.4.6 + swebench 5.0.1.
  Scripts: `run_pilot_all.sh` (serve + rollout + teardown), `grade_pilot.sh`
  (official harness), `preflight_litellm.py` (validates through litellm, not curl).
- **Pilot results:** 5 instances, 4 Submitted, 1 ContextWindowExceeded, 4/4
  patches resolved by the official grading harness.
- `eval_suite.sh`, `read_scores.py`, `inspect_gen.py` for running EvalPlus
  benchmarks (HumanEval+, MBPP+) through lm-eval-harness.
- `analyze_pilot.py` for analyzing SWE-bench rollout trajectories (exit statuses,
  step counts, context growth per instance).

### Changed

- **Speed re-measured on the actual release candidate:** 149.5 tok/s (n=5, range
  [1.691, 1.777] s). The earlier 146.4 tok/s figure was measured on the pre-renorm
  pre-strip checkpoint and transfers, but had never been measured on the artifact
  we would ship.
- README rewritten to reflect current status: results table, agentic serving docs,
  SWE-bench pipeline, corrected competitive bar.
- `serve_kat.sh` now includes `--enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser
  qwen3_xml` (required by mini-swe-agent's litellm model class, which sends
  `tools=[BASH_TOOL]` unconditionally regardless of prompt config).

### Fixed

- **SWE-bench tool calling was silently broken.** mini-swe-agent's default model
  class (`models/litellm_model.py:69`) sends `tool_choice: auto` unconditionally.
  Without `--enable-auto-tool-choice` on the server, every LM call returned 400.
  A curl-based preflight passed while the litellm path was broken, because curl
  skipped the layer with the bug. New preflight (`preflight_litellm.py`) goes
  through litellm with the same BASH_TOOL definition the agent uses.
- SWE-bench grading used wrong dataset name (`princeton-nlp/SWE-bench_Verified`
  instead of `SWE-bench/SWE-bench_Verified` for swebench 5.0.1).
- `--cache_level` flag removed from grade_pilot.sh (does not exist in swebench
  5.0.1, left over from older docs).

### Known limitations

- **32K context window** is the safe ceiling (KV budget fluctuates 0.49-1.41 GiB
  with the Windows desktop's VRAM). Devstral Small averages 86.9 LM calls/instance
  and many instances will hit the context limit before completing. The run must be
  disclosed as step-limited.
- **No pruning baseline.** The unpruned model is 69.3 GB bf16 and cannot fit this
  machine. Absolute scores (89.0% / 90.5%) are measured but the pruning cost is
  not. A cloud run for the baseline arm is the cheapest path (~$4-6).
- SWE-bench Verified no longer accepts leaderboard submissions outside academia.
- `KAT-Coder-V2.5-Dev` publishes no HumanEval/MBPP/EvalPlus, so there is no
  published number to compare our 89.0% / 90.5% against.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-17

First working pipeline. `Kwaipilot/KAT-Coder-V2.5-Dev` runs inside 16 GB of
consumer VRAM and produces correct code.

### Added

- REAP expert pruning at 50 percent for `qwen3_5_moe`, which required adding
  Qwen3.5/3.6 MoE support to the reap fork. llm-compressor's own REAP modifier
  rejects this architecture: it detects MoE layers by duck typing and requires
  `LinearExperts2D`, which Qwen3.5's fused `Qwen3_5MoeExperts` is not, so all 40
  layers are skipped.
- NVFP4 quantization in two schemes via llm-compressor. `NVFP4A16` is weight-only
  and data free, completing in 82 seconds. `NVFP4` is W4A4, requires calibration,
  and takes 28.7 minutes. Both produce the same size, 13.28 versus 13.29 GiB,
  because activations are never stored.
- Paired evaluation harness: held-out code perplexity via a custom
  `loglikelihood_rolling` lm-eval task, Wilcoxon and McNemar tests, bootstrap
  confidence intervals, and a resolution diagnostic that reports when a null
  result comes from an underpowered test rather than a real absence of effect.
- A/B latency benchmarking built on `vllm bench`, with repetition across separate
  process invocations, interleaved arms, and a discarded warmup.
- Precondition probes that run before expensive jobs, covering dataset
  availability, quantization toolchain readiness, and architecture support.

### Fixed

- Router renormalization was silently disabled during saliency computation. reap
  gated it on `getattr(config, "norm_topk_prob", False)`, but Qwen3.5 renormalizes
  unconditionally inside `Qwen3_5MoeTopKRouter.forward` and omits the flag from its
  config. Output directories were still named from the requested value, so runs
  appeared correctly configured while renormalization was off. Now resolved by
  asking the adapter, which knows what the architecture does. Committed separately
  for upstreaming.
- Pruned checkpoints were missing four files the loader requires:
  `preprocessor_config.json`, `video_preprocessor_config.json`, `merges.txt` and
  `vocab.json`. reap's save path drops them.
- Scripts hardcoded a home directory, making a clone unrunnable by anyone else.

### Verified on RTX 5070 Ti (SM120)

- 50 percent pruned plus NVFP4 is **13.28 GiB**, loads in **31 s** with no CPU
  offload, and generates correct code. NVFP4 compute is numerically correct on
  SM120 for `qwen3_5_moe`.
- Serving requires `enforce_eager=True`, `language_model_only=True`, and
  `gpu_memory_utilization=0.90`. `cpu_offload_gb` crashes in the UVA path and is
  unnecessary once pruned.
- The model declares a vision tower it has no trained weights for: 31,333 tensors,
  all under `model.language_model.`, none matching visual or vision.

### Known limitations

- Accuracy is unmeasured. No HumanEval or agentic benchmark has been run.
- Throughput is roughly 19 tok/s single stream, well short of the reported
  envelope for this architecture on comparable hardware.
- The current checkpoints were pruned before the renormalization fix, so they are
  a proof of path rather than a release build.
