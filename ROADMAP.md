# Roadmap

Status snapshot as of 2026-08-21. Not a changelog (see `CHANGELOG.md` for what
shipped) — this is where the project is headed and why, kept current rather
than historical.

## Done

- REAP 50% expert-prune + NVFP4A16 checkpoint published:
  [`Ttimms/KAT-Coder-V2.5-Dev-REAP-50-NVFP4A16`](https://huggingface.co/Ttimms/KAT-Coder-V2.5-Dev-REAP-50-NVFP4A16),
  12.45 GiB, fits a single 16 GB SM120 card. Accuracy reproduced on the shipped
  weights (HumanEval+, MBPP+ both inside published confidence intervals).
- W4A4 measured against the shipped A16 checkpoint (accuracy cost small: per
  `README.md`'s full table, -2.4pp HumanEval, -0.6pp HumanEval+, -0.3pp MBPP+
  — one problem apiece on the two EvalPlus sets; see Next Major below for the
  full re-quantization and throughput comparison this pointed to).
- SWE-bench Verified pilot baseline: **20/50 (40.0%)** at 32,768-token context.
  The 20/50 total and the 22-completed count are independently re-verified
  (2026-08-21) against the raw committed grading artifact,
  `results/hosted_vllm__kat-16gb.kat-coder-16gb-50.json`. The specific
  failure-reason breakdown — 18 of the 30 non-resolved instances attributed to
  `ContextWindowExceeded` — is stated consistently across five pre-existing
  repo files (README, CHANGELOG, HF_MODEL_CARD, both swebench config yamls)
  but its raw per-instance evidence (an `exit_statuses_*.yaml`, the format
  this harness uses to record failure reasons — confirmed present for other,
  smaller runs, e.g. `~/swebench_validate1/exit_statuses_*.yaml`) no longer
  exists on disk for this specific 50-instance run. Carried forward as
  previously reported, not independently re-verified tonight.
- Context-window fix measured and 1-instance-validated: `MAXLEN=49152
  MAXSEQS=2` gives 98,304 total KV tokens — both `--workers 2` rollout workers
  hold a full 49,152-token context simultaneously, zero preemption. Config
  lives in `scripts/swebench/kat_overrides_sota.yaml`.
- 2026-08-21 SOTA audit (`docs/optimization_research_2026-08-21.md`): vLLM
  0.27.1, the `lna-lab` community SM120 patches, and NVFP4 KV cache all
  investigated and rejected for the current checkpoint, with evidence. No
  changes needed to the serving config as a result — it was already correct.

## RESULT (2026-08-22): 50-instance pilot at 49K context — 26/50 = 52.0%

Launched on request, full 50 instances, graded with the official
`swebench.harness.run_evaluation` (not just exit-status counts):

```bash
cd ~/kat-coder-16gb/scripts/swebench
MAXLEN=49152 MAXSEQS=2 KAT_CONFIG=kat_overrides_sota.yaml \
  bash run_pilot_all.sh 50 ~/swebench_sota
bash grade_pilot.sh ~/swebench_sota
```

Zero infrastructure failures, zero crashes, clean GPU teardown. Rollout: 33
Submitted, 17 ContextWindowExceededError. Official grading of the 33
submitted (1 failed to apply as a patch, 32 actually completed): **26
resolved, 6 unresolved — 26/50 = 52.0%**, up from the prior 20/50 = 40.0% at
32K context. Full official report and raw predictions committed:
`results/hosted_vllm__kat-16gb.kat_pilot_024304_49k.json`,
`results/preds_49k.json`.

**The mechanism was not the one this section originally hypothesized — and
not the one first written up here either.** First pass at this writeup
compared 26/32 against 20/32, using "not-CWE" (50-18) as a stand-in for
"completed." Wrong: the old run's actual `completed_instances` (from its own
committed report, `results/hosted_vllm__kat-16gb.kat-coder-16gb-50.json`) is
**22, not 32** — there's a third failure category, `LimitsExceeded` (ran out
of agent turns, 9 instances), distinct from `ContextWindowExceeded`, that the
first pass missed. Caught by re-deriving both runs' numbers directly from
their raw JSON reports rather than trusting the prior write-up, on request to
audit everything.

Corrected: raising the ceiling did not meaningfully reduce the
`ContextWindowExceeded` rate — 17/50 = 34% now vs. 18/50 = 36% before,
functionally flat (this was checked mid-run too, at 16% then 26%, correctly
flagged as unstable rather than reported as a trend). The real lever was
`kat_overrides_sota.yaml` also raising `step_limit` 40→65 alongside the
context ceiling: `LimitsExceeded` failures went from 9 to 0, so 10 more
instances (22→32) reached a real completion attempt instead of running out
of agent turns first. Those newly-reachable instances resolve at a *lower*
rate than the ones that were already completing — resolved-of-completed went
from 90.9% (20/22) at 32K/step_limit-40 to 81.25% (26/32) at
49K/step_limit-65, consistent with them being the harder, longer problems
that need the extra turns — but enough of them resolved anyway that the net
resolved count still rose (20→26). More agent turns, not more context per
se, is what let the model reach and solve problems it previously couldn't
even attempt to finish.

Still below the 56.4% competitive bar (Devstral Small 2512), but closed most
of the gap (40.0% → 52.0% vs. a 16.4-point gap to close). `run_pilot_all.sh`'s
defaults changed to this SOTA config (`MAXLEN=49152 MAXSEQS=2
KAT_CONFIG=kat_overrides_sota.yaml`) since it's now the better-performing,
fully-validated option; the 32K/40.0% config is preserved and documented as
the reproducible fallback baseline, not deleted. README.md and
HF_MODEL_CARD.md updated to cite 52.0% as the headline number.

**Next, if pursued further:** per the correction above, the real lever was
the step-limit raise eliminating `LimitsExceeded` (9→0), not a
context-failure or completion-quality effect — so the context-*budget*
config (`kat_overrides_context_managed.yaml`, reduces `max_tokens` instead
of raising the ceiling) targets a different mechanism than what actually
drove this result, and shouldn't be assumed to help without its own test.
The 17 remaining `ContextWindowExceeded` instances were a candidate list for
two things investigated in `t-timms/kat-coder-16gb-serving-experiments`: (1)
the chat-template experiment (mixed/inconclusive on a diverse sample — see
that repo's `chat-template/NOTES.md`, not adopted) and (2) a real config gap
found 2026-08-22 — `presence_penalty`/`top_k` were missing from this file
relative to the base model's own documented sampling recommendation. Both
were full-pilot re-validated on 2026-08-23 and both regressed the score —
see the dated RESULT entry below for presence_penalty specifically. Neither
is adopted; `kat_overrides_sota.yaml` (this config, unmodified) remains the
best validated agentic serving config.

## CORRECTION (2026-08-22): reverted a premature default change, split into a candidate file

`presence_penalty`/`top_k` (see the entry below) were added directly into
`kat_overrides_sota.yaml` on 2026-08-22 — the same file that produced the
cited 52.0% result. That was a process mistake, caught via user question,
not internal review: it meant a fresh clone running the documented
quickstart with no `KAT_CONFIG` override no longer reproduced the number on
the model card, based on nothing more than a single-instance test.

Reverted `kat_overrides_sota.yaml` to byte-for-byte what it was when it
produced 52.0% (no `presence_penalty`/`top_k`). The addition now lives in
its own file, `kat_overrides_sota_presence_penalty.yaml` — same content plus
the two params, selected explicitly via `KAT_CONFIG=kat_overrides_sota_presence_penalty.yaml`,
never silently the default. `scripts/swebench/sync_configs.sh` updated to
sync it (it was missing from that script's hardcoded file list — would have
made the candidate file invisible to actual runs even after being selected).

**Standing rule going forward**: a change only gets merged into
`kat_overrides_sota.yaml` itself once it clears a full-pilot re-validation at
the same scale as the result already shipping in that file. Single-instance
or small-sample evidence — however promising, however well-reasoned — earns
a new, clearly-labeled, opt-in file, not an edit to the proven default. This
is the same discipline already applied to `kat_overrides_context_managed.yaml`;
it just wasn't applied consistently to this specific change when it was made.

Also corrected: `HF_MODEL_CARD.md`'s presence_penalty note (added the same
day this mistake was made) described the default as having changed when it
no longer has — re-synced to the live HF card to match this correction.

## RESULT (2026-08-22): GPTQ-based NVFP4A16 requantization — clean run, no measurable accuracy win

Ran to completion: 5h23min (`ONESHOT_DONE in 19374.1s`), zero exceptions,
zero RTN-fallback warnings across all 15,520 target modules (checked
directly against the full log, not assumed) - a genuinely clean GPTQ run
despite the MoE-Hessian-conditioning risk flagged before launch. Stripped
size **12.4512 GiB - exact byte-for-byte match** to the shipped RTN model
(same 47,013 tensors, same 0.8318 GiB phantom-vision-tower drop). The
"same size, only accuracy might change" premise held exactly.

Accuracy suite (`scripts/eval/eval_suite.sh`, same methodology as every
other comparison in this repo) against the shipped RTN baseline:

| | RTN (shipped) | GPTQ | discordant pairs (of n) | McNemar p |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| HumanEval+ | 90.85% | 89.63% | 6 / 164 | 0.68 |
| MBPP+ | 89.95% | 89.42% | 18 / 378 | 0.81 |

Paired McNemar test (same items, which model got which right - more
powerful than comparing two independent point estimates), not just raw
pass@1 deltas. **No statistically significant difference on either
benchmark.** Point estimates are slightly lower for GPTQ on both, but with
only 6 and 18 discordant pairs respectively - well under the ~40-50 this
project's own convention (`mcnemar_compare.py`) flags as needed for 80%
power at alpha=0.05 - this is underpowered to rule out a small real effect
either way. Correctly reported as "no detectable difference," not "GPTQ is
worse" or "GPTQ is equivalent."

**Verdict: does not clear the bar to proceed further.** The promotion
discipline set before this run (accuracy suite must show a real improvement
before a SWE-bench smoke test, let alone a bounded sample or full pilot) was
not met. Not shipped, not made the default. GPTQ+NVFP4 genuinely does beat
RTN in the literature this project verified before running - the null
result here is most plausibly explained by this specific model already
having very little room left to improve (the RTN baseline's own numbers,
90.9%/89.9%, are already close to ceiling for a 3B-active model), not by
GPTQ underperforming its documented advantage. `quantize_kat_gptq.py`,
`kat-50pct-nvfp4a16-gptq-stripped/`, and the eval artifacts
(`~/eval-suite-gptq/`) are kept as a documented negative result. Unlike
the earlier W4A4 throughput finding, the checkpoint itself is published -
[`Ttimms/KAT-Coder-V2.5-Dev-REAP-50-NVFP4A16-GPTQ`](https://huggingface.co/Ttimms/KAT-Coder-V2.5-Dev-REAP-50-NVFP4A16-GPTQ)
- for completeness and independent verification of this null result, not
as a recommended alternative to the primary release. Local copies were
deleted once the upload was verified byte-exact.

Also fixed along the way: `eval_suite.sh`'s summary loop had the same
two-metric-spelling bug its own comment already described for `run_task`
(`pass@1,...` vs `pass_at_1,...`) but the fix was never applied to the
summary loop itself - silently printed a blank MBPP+ line even on a
successful run. Fixed.

## RESULT (2026-08-23): presence_penalty/top_k full-pilot — regresses the score, not promoted

Full 50-instance pilot with `KAT_CONFIG=kat_overrides_sota_presence_penalty.yaml`,
identical setup to the 52.0% baseline run in every other respect
(`max_model_len 49152`, `max_num_seqs 2`, `step_limit 65`) via the same
`run_pilot_all.sh`. Confirmed before trusting the comparison: `--shuffle`
uses a hardcoded `random.seed(42)` in mini-swe-agent's own source
(`filter_instances()`), so both this run and the original 52.0% run drew
the identical 50 instances in the identical order — a valid paired
comparison, not confounded by different instance composition. Graded with
the official harness, artifact-verified (not exit-code-trusted):

| | baseline (`kat_overrides_sota.yaml`) | presence_penalty candidate |
|---|---:|---:|
| Resolved | **26/50 = 52.0%** | **24/50 = 48.0%** |
| Submitted | 32 | 28 |
| ContextWindowExceeded | 17 | 14 |
| LimitsExceeded | ~0 | 8 |
| Resolved-of-completed | 81.25% | 85.7% |

**Regression, not an improvement — 2 fewer resolved instances net.**
Mechanism is consistent with the single-instance test and the
`agentic-quality/` prompt-track findings that already flagged this exact
failure mode: presence_penalty modestly reduced context-ceiling failures
(17→14) and even slightly improved quality on attempts that did complete
(85.7% vs 81.25% resolved-of-completed) — but it caused far more instances
to exhaust the fixed 65-step turn budget before producing any patch at all
(`LimitsExceeded` 0→8). Suppressing literal repetition didn't reduce total
turns taken; it redirected them into exploring different (still
non-committal) variations instead of the same one. The quality gain on
completions doesn't offset the drop in how many instances complete at all.

**Not promoted. `kat_overrides_sota.yaml` is unchanged and remains the best
validated config.** This is the promotion-discipline (see the CORRECTION
entry above) working as designed: the shipped default was never at risk
during the ~24 hours this candidate looked promising on single-instance
evidence, because it was never merged into the file backing the cited
number. `kat_overrides_sota_presence_penalty.yaml` stays in the repo as a
documented negative result, not deleted — the same treatment as W4A4 and
the GPTQ requantization.

## PLAN (2026-08-22): GPTQ-based NVFP4A16 requantization — scoped, not yet run [SUPERSEDED BY RESULT ABOVE]

The shipped checkpoint (`quantize_kat.py`) uses `QuantizationModifier` — plain
round-to-nearest (RTN): each weight rounded to its nearest representable
NVFP4 value independently. `GPTQModifier` instead corrects each layer for the
error its own rounding decisions introduce, using a Hessian-based
least-squares pass. Before scoping this, checked directly rather than
assumed:

- GPTQ+NVFP4 has shipped in llm-compressor since v0.10.0 (confirmed via Red
  Hat's 2026-03-18 release notes), and current literature confirms GPTQ
  "consistently outperforms RTN" for NVFP4 recovery specifically.
- A newer method, MR-GPTQ (arXiv 2509.23202, 98-99% FP16 recovery claimed),
  is **not** usable here — its llm-compressor integration is an open,
  unimplemented RFC (`vllm-project/llm-compressor#2006`) as of 2026-08-22.
  Using it would mean a separate, unintegrated toolchain (FP-Quant/QuTLASS).
  Noted as a future watch item, not attempted.
- The pruned bf16 source checkpoint this needs (`reap-renorm_true-seed_42-0.50`,
  36 GiB) is still on disk — no need to re-run REAP pruning.
- The existing ignore list (router/gate protection) was re-verified directly
  against this exact checkpoint's module names before reuse, not assumed
  correct by inheritance. (One self-caught false alarm along the way: an
  initial check compared patterns against raw safetensors tensor names,
  which carry a trailing `.weight` llm-compressor's module-name matching
  does not use — corrected before concluding anything.)

Same file size and scheme as the shipped build (weight-only NVFP4A16, same
targets/ignore) — this is a same-size accuracy attempt, not a new tradeoff.
`quantize_kat_gptq.py` deliberately keeps `MAX_SEQ=2048` and the same
calibration set/seed as the shipped script, isolating the quantization
algorithm as the only variable changed — raising `MAX_SEQ` to match the 49K
serving context is a legitimate separate follow-up if this measures better,
not bundled in here.

**Status: script written and syntax/recipe-construction verified. Not yet
run** — needs a GPU-free window (calibration requires GPU forward passes).
Plan once it runs: accuracy suite (HumanEval+/MBPP+) against the current
90.9%/89.9% baseline using confidence intervals, not point estimates: if
GPTQ shows a real improvement, a 1-instance SWE-bench smoke test, then a
small bounded sample (5-10 instances) before considering a full-pilot
re-validation or shipping. If it's a wash, documented honestly and the
shipped RTN checkpoint stays the default — this is queued as the cheapest
next lever before a base-model swap (Ornith-1.5-35B-A3B), not a commitment
to ship regardless of outcome.

## Next major project: W4A4 re-quantization

The real remaining lever, not a same-session change. From
`docs/optimization_research_2026-08-21.md` §2: our current checkpoint is
NVFP4A16 (weight-only), and real FP4 tensor-core kernels require FP4×FP4
(weight+activation) inputs — there is no hardware path for a weight-only
scheme to reach them, on any GPU, so MoE experts always fall back to Marlin
regardless of vLLM version or device patches. Already measured on this exact
model (2026-08-20 entry): W4A4 reaches native kernels (`FlashInferCutlassNvFp4LinearKernel`
vs A16's `MarlinNvFp4LinearKernel` dequant fallback), same checkpoint size
(12.4532 vs 12.4512 GiB), -2.4pp HumanEval / -0.6pp HumanEval+ / -0.3pp MBPP+
accuracy cost (README's full table) — small relative to the ~38pp INT4-era
collapse QSpec reported (NVFP4's per-16-block scaling holds up much better).

**Correction 2026-08-21 (self-audit while re-reading this section against
README.md):** this section previously said "~+31% throughput" was "already
measured." It was not, and README.md's own "Measured costs" section says so
explicitly: *"Relative serving throughput is still unmeasured - that needs
`scripts/bench/bench_ab.sh`, and the smoke test is not a benchmark."* Traced
the "~31%" figure to its actual origin: a rough, uncited expectation written
in `scripts/quantize/quantize_kat.py`'s docstring (the *A16* script) as
motivation for building the weight-only checkpoint first, dated before any
W4A4 checkpoint existed to measure. It is not a citation to a specific paper
and not a local measurement — carrying it forward as "measured" was an
error. What IS measured and real: the kernel-path difference itself (Marlin
dequant-fallback vs native FlashInfer CUTLASS FP4 tensor-core GEMM) and the
accuracy deltas above. The actual throughput number is still open and is
exactly what `scripts/bench/bench_ab.sh` is for — run it on the new build
before quoting any percentage to anyone.

**Launch-prep audit done 2026-08-21 (no GPU/CPU compute spent — see
`docs/optimization_research_2026-08-21.md` §4 for full detail):** the recipe,
the environment, and the two open risk items below were checked against
upstream sources and this box's actually-installed packages/source before
committing CPU-hours to a calibration run. Summary: recipe already matches
upstream's own Qwen3.5-MoE NVFP4 example almost exactly (one deliberate
addition below); the SM12x NaN-risk bug (vLLM #35947/#37725) is confirmed
already fixed in this box's `~/vllm-src` (tag v0.26.0, built four months
after the fix merged); all four "Critical priority" lna-lab patches relevant
to MoE FP4 on SM120 are confirmed already present in the installed
`flashinfer==0.6.14`/`vllm-src` — verified by grep, not inferred (step 3
below, resolved without applying anything). One recipe change made:
`MAX_SEQ` raised 2048 → 4096 to match upstream's example and this project's
own 49,152-token serving window (roughly doubles CPU calibration wall-clock;
78 GiB free RAM confirmed sufficient). What's still genuinely unverified:
an end-to-end W4A4 MoE forward pass has never run on this card — the
individual kernel paths check out on paper but the specific combination
(runtime activation quant + FlashInfer CUTLASS MoE + piecewise CUDA graphs)
is untested here.

## RESULT (2026-08-21, GPU time spent): W4A4 vs A16 head-to-head, measured

The whole point of this project was "does native FP4 tensor-core compute beat
Marlin's dequant fallback." Measured properly (5 interleaved invocations per
arm, warmup discarded, median + range, `scripts/bench/bench_ab.sh` +
`bench_ab_analyze.py`), the answer is no, on this card, for this workload:

| | median decode | latency range (5 reps) | kernel |
|---|---:|---|---|
| A16 (published) | **18.8 tok/s** | 13.0–15.1 s | `MARLIN` |
| W4A4 (this build) | **14.5 tok/s** | 16.7–17.9 s | `FLASHINFER_CUTLASS` |

W4A4 runs at **0.77x** A16's speed, batch=1, in=512/out=256, **eager mode**.
The ranges don't overlap — this isn't noise, but it also isn't the whole
story: `bench_ab.sh` deliberately runs `--enforce-eager` to isolate kernel
dispatch from CUDA-graph effects, and this repo's own README documents that
CUDA graphs are worth ~7x on this card for A16 (eager 19.9 → PIECEWISE 139.4
→ FULL_AND_PIECEWISE 149.5 tok/s). The eager-only number above was correctly
flagged (by the user, not caught internally first — worth being honest about
that) as an incomplete basis for a publish decision, since W4A4 had never
been tried under CUDA graphs at all and a documented third-party bug class
(`lna-lab` patch #10: PyTorch Inductor bugs specifically in piecewise CUDA
graphs + NVFP4 activation-quant fusion) meant it wasn't obviously safe to
assume it would even run, let alone what it would measure.

**CONFIRMED under PIECEWISE CUDA graphs (2026-08-22, the production-representative
comparison)** — smoke-tested clean first (2/2 healthy, no Inductor crash;
the patch #10 risk class did not materialize on this stack), then measured
with the same 5-rep/interleaved/median+range methodology,
`gpu_memory_utilization=0.92` + `--kv-cache-dtype fp8` (needed for A16 to
even allocate KV cache under PIECEWISE at this box's current VRAM headroom —
see the memory-margin finding below, which applies here too):

| | median decode | range (5 reps) |
|---|---:|---|
| A16 (Marlin) | **142.5 tok/s** | 126.5–146.6 |
| W4A4 (native FP4) | **119.2 tok/s** | 114.3–128.7 |

A16's number here (142.5) lines up with the previously-published PIECEWISE
figure (139.4) — good cross-validation the methodology is sound. **W4A4 is
0.84x A16 under PIECEWISE — the direction from the eager-mode result holds.**
Interesting wrinkle: W4A4 gains proportionally *more* from CUDA graphs than
A16 does (eager→PIECEWISE: A16 7.6x, W4A4 8.2x), so the gap narrows from
0.77x to 0.84x, but it does not close or reverse. A16 remains faster in
absolute terms under both eager and graph-captured execution.

Combined with the accuracy suite (mixed, not uniformly different: HumanEval
92.07% vs A16's 95.7%, HumanEval+ 89.02% vs 90.9%, MBPP+ 91.01% vs 89.9% —
that last one favors W4A4), the two builds are a genuine speed/accuracy
tradeoff pair, now checked under the actual production serving mode, not
just eager. **Decision: keep A16 as the default/primary release** — it is
faster on this hardware for our own single-stream agentic use case — and
**publish W4A4 alongside it as a documented alternative**, since it reaches
a different kernel path (native FP4×FP4 tensor cores vs. Marlin's
dequant-then-bf16-compute) that may be preferable for other use cases or
serving stacks, and the comparison itself is worth having on record: the
theoretical throughput advantage of native FP4×FP4 compute over a dequant
fallback did not materialize on SM120 consumer Blackwell for this
single-stream workload, under either eager or graph-captured execution —
worth documenting plainly, since the earlier optimism (see the "Next major
project" framing below, and the retracted "~+31% throughput" claim) turned
out to be wrong and the reproducible reason is now on record. Raw
JSON/logs: `~/bench-ab-piecewise/`.

**A real, separate finding surfaced getting this measurement**: at identical
`vllm bench latency` settings (`gpu_memory_utilization=0.90`,
`max_model_len=2048`), A16/Marlin failed to allocate KV cache on **every**
invocation (6/6, both the unstripped and the properly-stripped checkpoint),
while W4A4 succeeded on every invocation at the same settings. Marlin's
dequant-to-bf16 path needs meaningfully more non-weight runtime workspace
than the native FP4 kernel — the checkpoint sizes are nearly identical, so
this isn't a size effect. A16 only became bench-able at
`gpu_memory_utilization=0.91` + `max_model_len=1024` (still hit the same
razor-thin-margin failure on 1 of 6 attempts even then — Windows-desktop
VRAM contention on this box, already documented elsewhere in this repo, is
close enough to the edge that this specific benchmark shape is fragile).
This has no bearing on the production serving config (`kat_overrides_sota.yaml`
already runs A16 successfully at 0.92 with different settings) — it's
specific to `vllm bench latency`'s memory-profiling path — but if this
benchmark is ever re-run, start there rather than rediscovering it.

Detail, raw JSON, and logs: `~/bench-ab/` on the WSL box.

Scope for that project (steps 1-4 done 2026-08-21, see RESULT above; 5-7 were
audit/prep, not blocked on the result):

1. ~~Run `scripts/quantize/quantize_kat_w4a4.py`~~ — done. 4096-token
   calibration, 29.7 min, verified `weights=4 acts=4`, 128 experts, stripped
   to 12.4532 GiB.
2. ~~Smoke-test~~ — done, with a real finding: the FIRST invocation crashed
   (`CUDA error: an illegal memory access`) during the very first post-JIT
   warm-up forward pass. A rerun with `CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1`, reusing the
   same compiled kernels, passed clean (`SMOKE_PASS`, 4/4 coherent). Root
   cause was never isolated (no Xid/dmesg signal available in WSL2) — treat
   as a one-time JIT-compile-adjacent hiccup, not a confirmed-safe kernel,
   if this checkpoint is ever touched again after a `~/.cache/flashinfer`
   clear.
3. ~~Re-run the accuracy suite~~ — done, see RESULT above.
4. ~~Measure actual throughput~~ — done, see RESULT above. This is also the
   correction of the retracted "~+31% throughput, already measured" claim
   that was in this file earlier the same day.
5. ~~Revisit the `lna-lab/blackwell-geforce-nvfp4-gemm` patch set~~ — done
   2026-08-21 without spending GPU/CPU time: all four patches critical to MoE
   FP4 on SM120 are already upstream in this box's installed
   flashinfer/vllm-src. Nothing to apply.
6. `VLLM_USE_AOT_COMPILE=1` JIT-cost test — not pursued; lower priority once
   A16 was confirmed as the faster default for this hardware.
7. **Publish strategy: keep A16 as the default/primary release; publish
   W4A4 alongside it as a documented alternative.** Done 2026-08-22 —
   [`Ttimms/KAT-Coder-V2.5-Dev-REAP-50-NVFP4-W4A4`](https://huggingface.co/Ttimms/KAT-Coder-V2.5-Dev-REAP-50-NVFP4-W4A4),
   with a model card presenting the head-to-head measurement directly. The
   comparison itself (native FP4 vs. Marlin+dequant on SM120 consumer
   Blackwell for single-stream decode) is worth keeping on record and
   citing if this gets revisited, e.g. at higher batch sizes where the
   native kernel's throughput-over-latency tradeoff may look different (not
   measured — this session only tested batch=1, matching the agentic
   single-stream use case the model targets).

The `~/vllm-env-027` / `~/vllm-src-027` build (vLLM 0.27.1, SM120, torch
2.13.0+cu130) is left on disk as a starting point if this project wants to
revisit the two SM120-specific decode-throughput fixes noted in
`docs/optimization_research_2026-08-21.md` §1 — those didn't help the A16
checkpoint but weren't tested against W4A4's different kernel path.

## Longer-horizon / not scheduled

- **Candidate performance levers surfaced 2026-08-22, not yet tested against
  this checkpoint — side note for the next experiment, not acted on this
  session:**
  - [FreeToken](https://github.com/FlashML-org/FreeToken) (FlashML-org, 503
    stars, paper arXiv:2608.16157, authors include Song Han/Ion
    Stoica/Matei Zaharia) — an edge-native MoE serving engine (not a vLLM
    fork; a different stack), pitched specifically at running frontier MoE
    models on consumer hardware via bandwidth-adaptive CPU-GPU co-execution
    and a global LRU **expert cache** with elastic VRAM reallocation between
    expert cache and KV cache, no restart needed. Native NVFP4 support,
    explicit RTX 50-series support. Why it matters: this project's entire
    premise has been "prune 50% of experts to fit 16 GB" — if expert
    offloading genuinely works, it could let this project serve the
    **unpruned or much-less-pruned** base model instead, skipping the REAP
    accuracy tax entirely, a different and potentially bigger lever than
    anything pulled this session. Unverified at this project's scale;
    brand-new repo (created 2026-07-20). Would need real install +
    compatibility testing against the pruned checkpoint before trusting it
    over vLLM.
  - [Qwen-Sharp-Chat-Templates](https://huggingface.co/peculiar-ragdoll/Qwen-Sharp-Chat-Templates)
    (172 likes) — a drop-in `chat_template.jinja` for Qwen3.5/3.6/3.8 (this
    model's base family) that fixes the exact `<think>`-tax issue this
    project already documented itself (`kat_overrides_sota.yaml`'s own
    comment: "the `<think>` preamble alone consumed 300 tokens without
    finishing"). Author-claimed, not independently verified: -59% answer
    tokens on a Claw-Eval benchmark, 2.5x faster median time-to-fix on
    SWE-bench-Live at equal resolve rate. Also fixes tool-call-escalation
    bugs (long tracebacks not triggering retry, false-positive retry loops
    on code search) — same bug *class* this project had to patch itself for
    SWE-bench (`--enable-auto-tool-choice`, the litellm tool-calling fix in
    `CHANGELOG.md`). Much cheaper to test than FreeToken — a one-file
    template swap, no re-quantization or serving-stack change — but tuned
    against upstream Qwen3.5/3.6/3.8, not against KAT-Coder's specific
    REAP-pruned, MTP-field-carrying fork, so verify it doesn't break this
    model's chat format/tool-call parsing before trusting the claimed gains.
    If this pans out, it's orthogonal to the W4A4/A16 quantization-scheme
    question entirely — a token-efficiency lever, not a kernel-throughput
    one, and could stack with whichever checkpoint gets used.

- GGUF quant for reach (llama.cpp/Ollama/LM Studio compatible) — current
  model has 74 HF downloads (verified 2026-08-21); NVFP4A16 needs vLLM +
  Blackwell specifically, which caps the addressable audience. Re-verified
  2026-08-21, correcting an error introduced earlier in this same session
  (see `docs/optimization_research_2026-08-21.md` addendum for the full
  story): the same author (`gbuzhf`) publishes two distinct GGUF repos for
  this base model —
  [`KAT-Coder-V2.5-Dev-MTP-GGUF`](https://huggingface.co/gbuzhf/KAT-Coder-V2.5-Dev-MTP-GGUF)
  (45.3K downloads, full unpruned model, MTP head grafted from
  Qwen3.6-35B-A3B) and
  [`KAT-Coder-V2.5-Dev-REAP-205E-MTP-GGUF`](https://huggingface.co/gbuzhf/KAT-Coder-V2.5-Dev-REAP-205E-MTP-GGUF)
  (5.3K downloads, REAP-pruned **256→205 experts, 19.9%** — a much lighter
  prune than our 50% — same grafted MTP head, KLD-measured against the
  unpruned original: mean KLD 0.059, 94.6% top-1 token agreement, no
  downstream coding benchmark run). `README.md`'s "Honest positioning" and
  `HF_MODEL_CARD.md`'s "Prior art" sections cite the second (205E) repo
  correctly — no fix needed there. If we ship a GGUF, the useful comparison
  is prune depth (50% vs. their 19.9%) and that we'd publish SWE-bench
  numbers where they explicitly do not.
- Base-model swap to Ornith-1.5-35B-A3B — tracked separately in the
  `sota-ornith-build` branch of the private 60%-experiment repo, not this one.
